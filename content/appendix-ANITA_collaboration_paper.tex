\chapter{ANITA Followup Paper}
\label{app:ANITA_collaboration_paper}

This and the following appendices contain papers to which I made significant contributions. The first, ``A search for IceCube events in the direction of ANITA neutrino candidates,'' corresponds to the analysis described in Chapter~\ref{sec:ANITA}. It set the first limits on astrophysical point source explanations of the ANITA events, and set constraining model-independent limits by leveraging the secondary \nutau distributions from \nutau regeneration. 

It was published in \textit{The Astrophysical Journal}, Volume 892, Number 1 on March 27, 2020.
