\chapter{Fast Response Analysis Paper}
\label{app:FRA_external_paper}

This appendix contains the paper which describes the Fast Response Analysis pipeline. The beginning of the paper serves as a technical explanation of the pipeline as well as a description of how we choose sources to follow up. It also summarizes the results from analyses which were run in response to external triggers (neglecting our followups of IceCube alert events). 

It was published in \textit{The Astrophysical Journal}, Volume XX, Number YY in BLABLABLA 2021.
